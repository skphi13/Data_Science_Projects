| 3 | [Megaline Plan Statistical Data Analysis](https://github.com/skphi13/Megaline_SDA_Project) | In this statistical data analysis project for telecom operator Megaline, we will determine which prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, bring in more revenue to determine their budget for their advertising team. | Statistical Data Analysis, Probability Theory, Testing Hypothesis
| 4 | [Vehicle Data Analysis](https://github.com/skphi13/Car_Analysis_Project) | This project compares the statistical data of US vehicles on sale. | Intermediate Python
| 5 | [Ice Video Game Success Analysis](https://github.com/skphi13/Ice_Video_Game_Analysis_Project) | Identify patterns that determine whether or not a video game will succeed. Dataset from video game store Ice. | Seaborn for Visualizations
| 6 | [Zuber Ride Sharing Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/skphi13/Zuber_Rideshare_EDA_Project) | Our goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We will also analyze the data from competitors and test the hypothesis that weather impacts ride frequency. | SQL, PySpark
| 7 | [Megaline Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/skphi13/Megaline_Machine_Learning_Project) | Develop a model that picks the correct plan for Megaline's legacy customers. | Machine Learning, Regression, Model Improvements
| 8 | [Beta Bank Customers Retention ML Model](https://github.com/skphi13/Beta_Bank_Customer_Retention_ML_Model) | Beta Bank customers are leaving little by little, chipping away every month. We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.  | Supervised Learning, Classification Metrics, Imbalanced Classification, Regression Metrics, Feature Preparation
| 9 | [OilyGiant Profit Prediction ML Model](https://github.com/skphi13/OilyGiant_Profit_Prediction_ML_Project) | Find the best new place for OilyGiant to create a new oil well by creating a model for predicting the volume reserves in the new well. | Business Metrics, Data Collection, Bootstrapping
| 10 | [Zyfra Gold Mining ML Model Prediciton](https://github.com/skphi13/Zyfra_Gold_Mining_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Project) | Zyfra is a gold ore company that needs a machine learning model to predict how much gold can be recovered from a gold ore. | *Integrated Project*
| 11 | [Sure Tomorrow Insurance Customer Benefit Prediction](https://github.com/skphi13/Sure_Tomorrow_Insurance_ML_Prediction) | The Sure Tomorrow company needs a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. | Linear Algebra, Matrices & Matrix Operations, Vectors & Vector Operations
| 12 | [Rusty Bargain Car Value ML Model](https://github.com/skphi13/Rusty_Bargain_Car_Value_ML_Model) | Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers.
